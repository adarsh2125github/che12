        <h2>Conservation Strategies</h2>
        <h2>Biodiversity conservation strategies can be broadly divided into two categories: In-situ Conservation and Ex-situ Conservation.</h2>

            <h3>In-situ Conservation:</h3>
            
            <h4>involves the conservation of species within their natural habitat.</h4>
            <h4>The natural ecosystem is maintained and protected.</h4>
            <h4>It is a cost-effective and convenient method of conserving biodiversity.</h4>
            <h4>A large number of living organisms can be conserved simultaneously.</h4>
            <h4>Since the organisms are in a natural ecosystem, they can evolve better and can easily adjust to different environmental conditions.</h4>
            <h4>Protected areas where in-situ conservation takes place include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves.</h4>
            <h3>Ex-situ Conservation:</h3>
            
            <h4>It involves the breeding and maintenance of endangered species in artificial ecosystems such as zoos, nurseries, botanical gardens, gene banks, etc.</h4>
            <h4>There is less competition for food, water, and space among the organisms.</h4>
            <h4>The animals are provided with a longer time and breeding activity.</h4>
            <h4>All the varieties of food, timber plants, livestock, microbes, and agricultural animals should be conserved.</h4>
            <h4>All the economically important organisms should be identified and conserved.</h4>
            <h4>Unique ecosystems should be preserved first .</h4>
